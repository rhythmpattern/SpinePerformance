Latest fresh install of spine with default export option.
Latest defold editor: 1.4.4 alpha.  Problem exists on earlier versions.
Created a new defold project, changed the resolution.
No other project changes except increased [rig] max count. 
Added spine json, then basic setup.
Delay was around 30 seconds on a fresh install. Time starts when window loads and I stop when something shows on screen. 
I think after some files get cached the time decreases ..?
